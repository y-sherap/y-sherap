I am a Front-End Developer for user-oriented digital products with 4+ years of prior experience in product management and project coordination and management. My work spans creating feature-rich user interfaces within the health-tech and media spaces through cross-functional collaboration. 
   
I am interested in the confluence between technology and our natural and built environments and how these forces shape the world around us.
